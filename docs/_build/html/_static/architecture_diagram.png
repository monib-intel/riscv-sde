# Architecture Diagram

This is a placeholder for the architecture diagram. To generate the actual diagram, please install Graphviz and run the following command:

```bash
dot -Tpng docs/_static/architecture_diagram.dot -o docs/_static/architecture_diagram.png
```

The architecture diagram shows the main components of the RISC-V Silicon Design Environment:

1. **Build Infrastructure**
   - Configuration Files
   - Flow Definitions
   - Infrastructure

2. **Design**
   - Hardware RTL
   - Software Benchmarks

3. **Output**
   - Simulation Results
   - Synthesis Results
   - Analysis Reports

The components are connected as follows:
- Configuration files configure the flows
- Flows compile software and simulate hardware
- Hardware and software combine to produce simulation results
- Hardware is synthesized to produce synthesis results
- Simulation and synthesis results are analyzed to produce analysis reports
- Infrastructure provides execution environment for flows
